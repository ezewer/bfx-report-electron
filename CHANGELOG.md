## [4.36.2] - 2025-07-16

### Added

- Implemented a class for the sync schema models to typify and unify model objects. PR: [bfx-reports-framework#459](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/459)

### Changed

- Reworked sync schema model usage to use the new model interface implemented in the previous PR #459. It speeded up the work by avoiding the usage of `cloneDeep` fn based on `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` for the models. PR: [bfx-reports-framework#461](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/461)

- Added native behavior to minimize and close the loading window. The main reason is to provide the ability to `minimize` and then `restore` the loading window on all OSs as each OS has a specific behavior.

## [4.34.1] - 2025-04-09

### Added

- Added ability to avoid queuing sync by scheduler if sync is already in progress to prevent redundant sync in case a user has lots of data and sync takes time until the run of the scheduler. PR: [bfx-reports-framework#446](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/446)

### Changed

- Changed the order of getting the price of the pub trades moving from the end to the start by timestamps to overcome some rare cases. Related to this issue: [bfx-report-electron#493](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/issues/493). PR: [bfx-reports-framework#445](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/445)

- Updated deps with vulnerabilities and added `package-lock` file due to the last security requirements. PRs: [bfx-report-ui#912](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/912), [bfx-report#424](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/424), [bfx-report#427](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/427), [bfx-reports-framework#439](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/439), [bfx-reports-framework#441](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/441), [bfx-report-express#45](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-express/pull/45), [bfx-report-electron#518](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/518), [bfx-report-electron#520](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/520)
- Updated `axios` to `1.8.4` in the UI. PR: [bfx-report-ui#911](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/911)

## [4.33.0] - 2025-02-19

### Added

- Implemented `Electron` app menu bar and corresponding functionality in the UI title instead of the native one. This is very useful as it saves overall space and at the same time constantly displays the menu and does not require the user to press the `Alt` key to display it (as the practice has shown, because of the last one, many inexperienced users do not even know about the existence of menu functions). Available for the `Windows` and `Linux` app users. On the `Mac` we have to hide the menu in the UI and show the native electron menu bar due to some `MacOS` specifics, it's impossible to have proper menu item control from the UI. PR: [bfx-report-ui#898](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/898)
- Added exponential backoff and jitter for bfx-api requests to improve `Rate Limit` bypassing. Here we implemented `Decorrelated Jitter` described in AWS article https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/ And added a small improvement to shift the starting point of jitter for each iteration. In practice, it helps better to move through the `Rate Limit` for the `Sync` and `Tax Report`. PR: [bfx-report#420](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/420)

### Changed

- Changed font family to `Inter` similar to used on the main platform. PR: [bfx-report-ui#896](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/896)
- Reworked and optimized `ThemeSwitcher` component in a more performant way and reduced redundant code. PR: [bfx-report-ui#897](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/897)
- Changed the font family from `Roboto` to `Inter` in the Electron env to prevent throwing error due to the last UI changes (electron layouts use font source from the UI sub-module). PR: [bfx-report-electron#494](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/494)
- Disabled native title menu bar to use UI implementation via Electron renderer IPC bridge. PR: [bfx-report-electron#504](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/504)
- Migrated from `html-pdf` to `puppeteer` for `pdf` creation as the first one repo is not `maintained` anymore. PRs: [bfx-reports-framework#432](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/432), [bfx-report#419](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/419)

### Fixed

- Fixed the UI setup flow for the `dev` mode. PR: [bfx-report-electron#485](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/485)
- Fixed error metadata processing, related to this test pipeline: https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/actions/runs/12114987593/job/33772854879 PR: [bfx-report#418](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/418)

## [4.32.0] - 2025-01-22

### Added

- Added the backend logic to move the electron app menu bar to the UI title instead of the electron one so that we can customize the electron menu, as the native electron menu API doesn't provide that. It allows us to build the menu in the UI in one small line with the main app title and typical window buttons (minimize, maximize, and close in the top corner). This is very useful as it saves overall space and at the same time constantly displays the menu and does not require the user to press the `Alt` key to display it (as practice has shown, because of the last one, many inexperienced users do not even know about the existence of menu functions). PRs: [bfx-report-electron#478](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/478), [bfx-facs-db-better-sqlite#11](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-facs-db-better-sqlite/pull/11)
- Added a small typical `_` button (in the top right corner) to minimize the loading window. PR: [bfx-report-electron#479](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/479)
- Added the logout flow for web users and prevented the issue when logged-out users are still logged in after the page refreshing. PR: [bfx-report-ui#889](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/889)

### Changed

- Renamed `Filter` button to `Generate` and also disabled it during the initial synchronization to prevent `Tax Report` generation errors. Implemented corresponding notice for the users during the initial sync. PR: [bfx-report-ui#888](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/888)
- Actualized app download link generation flow. PR: [bfx-report-ui#890](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/890)
- Actualized `Reports` translations and extended coverage for newly added elements/features. PR: [bfx-report-ui#891](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/891)
- Improved theme setting flow and fixed issues noted after the latest `Electron` version update. PR: [bfx-report-ui#893](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/893)

### Fixed

- Fixed `isAuthTokenGenerationError` flag processing in query response for the 2FA re-login after token expiration. PR: [bfx-report-ui#892](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/892)

## [4.11.0] - 2023-09-20

### Added

- Added ability to show success dialog for `CSV` exporting only after the `emitCsvGenerationCompletedToOne` event was sent by the backend for better understanding by users when the exporting process actually completed. PR: [bfx-report-ui#698](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/698)

## [4.10.0] - 2023-08-23

### Added

- Added currency lists for platform consistency. PRs: [bfx-report#323](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/323), [bfx-reports-framework#310](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/310), [bfx-report-ui#688](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/688)

- Added ability to overwrite `RPC` timeout to have `httpRpcTimeout` and `wsRpcTimeout` options that can be overwritten in the electron environment to `10mins` for complicated reports which can have a lot of internal calls to the `BFX API` that can take significant time. It fixed the following issues: [bfx-report-electron#238](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/issues/238), [bfx-report-electron#240](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/issues/240), [bfx-report-electron#241](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/issues/241). PRs: [bfx-report-express#31](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-express/pull/31), [bfx-report-electron#242](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/242)
- Implemented colored displaying on mobiles `amounts`, `volumes`, etc, the same way as on the desktop for better readability. PR: [bfx-report-ui#691](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/691)

### Changed

The idea is to have extra data in case we catch an error from `BFX API` side and on the UI use a transparent error message which can contain `BFX API` error reasons. PRs: [bfx-report#327](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/327), [bfx-report-ui#692](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/692)
- Fixed notifications positioning on page scrolling: When setting Table Scroll is turned off, the results of using `Sum` can appear below or above the part of the table that's currently visible. Fixed to be anchored to a specific part of the currently visible screen rather than a specific point in the table. PR: [bfx-report-ui#686](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/686)
- Fixed redundant `getUsers` calls for the hosted version. PR: [bfx-report-ui#689](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/689)
- Fixed issue with crashing `Change Logs` report when users remove the `2FA` option from their account. PR: [bfx-report-ui#690](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/690)

## [4.9.3] - 2023-08-09

### Fixed

- Fixed `start` timestamp of `BFX API` queries to be at least `Date.UTC(2013)` = `1356998400000` ms. The issue is the following: some restrictions of the `BFX API` are changed for the `Funding Credits History`, if we set `start: 0` throws `Internal Server Error` from the `API` side. It's an issue for the `sync` mode (as we start syncing with `0`) and setting the default value for requests. PRs: [bfx-report#324](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/324), [bfx-reports-framework#307](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/307)

## [4.9.2] - 2023-08-02

- Improved sync time estimation flow as follows: in addition to existing emitting `WS` events when the next collection is syncing to not hold the previous time value (some collections can sync very long) adds an ability to emit the `progress` event every `1sec` with new values `spentTime` and `leftTime` for better UX (so that the user does not think that sync has stalled). PR: [bfx-reports-framework#303](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/303)
- Changed `Rate Limits` for public endpoints: `trades` to 15 req/min, `candles` to 60 req/min. PR: [bfx-reports-framework#304](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/304)

### Fixed

- Fixed handling bfx api `ERR_AUTH_API: ERR_INVALID_CREDENTIALS` error to prevent showing `500 Internal Server Error` and error modal dialog in the electron app. PR: [bfx-report#318](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/318)
- Fixed the issue [#215](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/issues/215) related to `MaxListenersExceededWarning` warning for the electron windows. PR: [bfx-report-electron#229](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-electron/pull/229)

### Fixed

- Added `Rate Limit` router to control `BFX API` requests bandwidth to resolve the long timeout issue and help users to go through the data sync. Bumped API call timeout to `90s`. Reduced redundant `positionsAudit` calls to facilitate sync. Fixed stuck event loop to fix `WS` timeout on big data. PRs: [bfx-report#314](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/314), [bfx-reports-framework#298](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/298)

PR: [bfx-report-ui#630](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report-ui/pull/630)

### Changed

- Added the `temporarily_unavailable` BFX error handler, it's related to issues when the main platform is under maintenance. Instead showing an error modal dialog under the electron app would show the network issue message. And also it added some retries for fetching data as it was done earlier for the common `isENetError` checker. PR: [bfx-report#290](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-report/pull/290)

### Changed

- Provided a `new Sync Core` to use temp tables during sync processing. PR: [bfx-reports-framework#240](https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bfx-reports-framework/pull/240). The main idea is to put data fetched from the BFX api_v2 to temp tables to have consistent data in the main tables and allow users to request reports from all sections any time even sync is going on, except the first sync when the DB is empty. When the sync is finished and temp tables are filled all data will be moved to the main tables in one atomic transaction thus users don't have to experience transitional processes. Basic changes:
  - Implemened `new Sync Core` to use temp tables
  - Improved transaction flow to fix the `database is locked` issue
